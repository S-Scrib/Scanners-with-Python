Hi There! Nothing crazy here, made a brief port scanner using Socket just to show I could for the portfolio really. I used Nmap's practice port scanning site, scanme.nmap.org, for the scan since they give permission to. Using ther script provided I performed the scan and lo' and behold, I found an open port

Port 80, http, is open on the fictitious site. Could be a vulnerability since it is unencrypted! Looks like the scanner worked!
